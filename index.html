                                    An endless stream of contracts, tax issues, labor relations, corporate papers - legal work distracts you from doing business. But there is not much work to do to hire an in-house lawyer.

                                    In addition, over time, the work will become the same type and uninteresting for a full-time lawyer. And we know very well how difficult it is to find a good candidate with experience in the field of information technology in Ukraine.

                                    Instead of just providing legal services, we will hire a lawyer or a whole team that will fit into the daily life of your company.

                                    Once a week, or week after month, you have your own lawyer by your side. Anyone in the company can catch it at the coffee maker and just talk about current affairs instead of waiting for update status.
